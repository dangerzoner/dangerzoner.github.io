dangerzone's website, i made this website with microsoft frontpage combined with 
paint.net to create the textures and artworks and it took me a whole day of 
working non-stop to fully set this site up, so hope you enjoy your stay</font></p>

made, you can find more information about me and what i do as well as other ways 
of contacting me, you can also find artworks and gifs i made here as well but 
they are mostly reposted from my

and my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.furaffinity.net/user/dangerzonee/">

times as well)</font></p>
